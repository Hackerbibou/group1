            <p>
                In the late 1850's, former dentist turned bounty-hunter Dr. King Schultz buys the freedom of a man named Django from a slave trader duo in a quest to find and kill some men he wants dead. Afterwards,
                 Django sets out with help from Schultz to find and rescue his wife Broomhilda who like him was sold into slavery by an anonymous owner. 
                 Their journey takes them to a plantation called Candieland, 
                owned by a ruthless tycoon Calvin Candie. Also, they come to some suspicions of the head slave named Stephen.

            <p>
                The film is set in the antebellum South, where slavery was legal, although those wondering where was 
                Django Unchained filmed might be interested to know it was in California, Louisiana, and Wyoming.
                    <br>
                The main themes of Django Unchained are slavery, revenge, and justice.
